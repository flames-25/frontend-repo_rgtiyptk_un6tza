          Natasha (Ntsha) is a traditional artist devoted to the textures of human feeling. Her
          practice moves through charcoal, graphite, and slow layers of acrylic, finding tenderness in
          restraint and presence. These works seek the quiet emotional spaces that language leaves
          behind—where hands can speak. Each piece is an invitation to breathe, to notice, and to be
          accompanied by stillness.
